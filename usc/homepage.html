                <p>I was born in Los Angeles, raised in Taiwan, and am now returning to California for university. As a graphic design enthusiast and self-taught computer programmer, I've always adored the connections between technology and design made possible by the ceaseless innovations in our ever-changing world. <br><br>
    
                I picked up computer coding as a hobby towards the end of elementary school. While I fawned over One Direction like my classmates did, I was also watching Steve Jobs and Jony Ives' Apple keynotes on repeat. Whether it's sketching out floor plans and interior designs while maximizing the functions of each component, or simply coding small projects and transitions, I've always had an aptitude for the combination of the innumerable forms of design and cutting edge technology. <br><br>
                
                I am currently a freshman studying psychology and data science at the University of Southern California. Saying that I'm interested in bridging together artful conception and innovation is an understatement, it is what I've dedicated my time to for years. <br><br>
                
                When I'm not at school, you can find me indulging the heavenly truffle parmesan fries at The Lobster by the Santa Monica Pier, constantly redesigning <a href="www.155hrs.com" target="_blank"> my website </a>, or recording covers for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@boobeh_" target="_blank">TikTok</a> (you might also find me with a camera in hand every once in a blue moon)! <br> <br>
                
                Feel free to reach out to me and start a conversation about music, fries, and just about anything and everything!</p>

                <h1>USC...?</h1>
                <p>usc definitely has a reputation, whether it's good or bad is up to personal discretion. <br> <br>
                i personally am completely in love with this school. i love the school spirit, the "work hard play hard" culture, the classes offered, the extracurricular clubs i'm a part of...the list goes on. but just because i like usc doesn't mean that you will too. hopefully you've all done your school research before you applied; if you didn't, i strongly recommend you to at least read about usc a bit before you come. <br><br>
                usc's reputation as a party school might be concerning to a lot of incoming students, especially with the school's recent scandals with the fraternities. some tips for navigating the school's party cultures:</p>
                <div id="list">
                    <ol>
                        <li>never go to a party alone, always have a trusted friend who will be able to take care of you
                            <ul>
                                <li>it's understandable that you and your friends will want to have fun at parties, but it's more important to be careful of your surroundings. one of you must stay sober; one of you must be the "mom" of the group.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>know the reputations of the parties you're going to
                            <ul>
                                <li>talk to your friends to see if they're well aquainted with the party scene. if they are, ask them about the parties you're going to. some fraternities are known for spiking their drinks. knowing what you're going into will help you prepare for what's to come.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>make sure to know your limit
                            <ul>
                                <li>know when to stop when it comes to substances. do not drink or smoke more than you can take. while you're looking to have fun on a night out, it's also imparative that you take care of yourself.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>remember to have fun!
                            <ul>
                                <li>studying and working hard all week (or even longer!) can be incredibly draining. have fun with your friends on a casual night out will definitely help release all your pent up stress! just remember to be careful while you're enjoying yourself!</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>after my first year at usc, i feel incredibly comfortable expressing my identities fully. everyone is inclusive, open minded, and just incredibly kind. i've met some of the kindest souls on earth here at this school. there are lot of oppotunities with extracurricular clubs and other events that really promote an inclusive learning environment.</p>

                    <h3>decoration tips</h3> <br>
                    <p>you'll probably want to decorate your dorm with cute lightings and posters hung up across your dorm room walls. they <em>are</em> very cute and will definitely make your dorm feel a lot more cozy, but something to keep in mind is your dorm's rules on hanging things on walls. for usc's dorms, you are not allowed to leave marks on walls, so definitely be careful if what you're planning to hang up will leave a mark on your walls. <br><br>
                    while we all love a bit of christmas spirit in our dorm rooms, christmas trees and wreaths are also banned from usc dorms. there are cute alternatives to christmas trees being sold in the usc village target though!</p>
