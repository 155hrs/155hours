                <p>My Dear Melancholy (stylized as My Dear Melancholy,) is the first extended play by Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd. It was released on March 30, 2018, through XO and Republic Records. Primarily produced by Frank Dukes, who serves as an executive producer alongside the Weeknd, it features contributions from Gesaffelstein, as well as Mike Will Made It, DaHeala, Skrillex and Daft Punk's Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, among others. <br> <br>
                My Dear Melancholy has been described as a return to the darker style of the Weeknd's earlier work, such as Trilogy (2012) and Kiss Land (2013). The EP was supported by the lead single, "Call Out My Name". It received generally favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200.</p>

                <p>The project has been described as "darker" than the Weeknd's previous studio releases Beauty Behind the Madness and Starboy, and has been described as a return to his earlier work though with more electronic music based production with Israel Daramola from Spin describing it as him "returning to the darkened drug den sounds of his earlier work". My Dear Melancholy is characterized as an alternative R&B, R&B and electropop project with production credits from Skrillex and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo from Daft Punk. My Dear Melancholy's only feature is techno artist Gesaffelstein who produced the tracks "I Was Never There" and "Hurt You". <br><br>
                Lyrically, My Dear Melancholy focuses on heartbreak and anger related to a breakup. The lyrics focus around the Weeknd's past relationships, mainly his highly publicized romances with model Bella Hadid and singer and actress Selena Gomez. The theme is a complete change from the Weeknd's past two projects which were pop-based and more mainstream. The Weeknd sings in relation to Gomez's kidney transplant operation and her relationship with Justin Bieber with CNN's Lisa Respers France labelling Gomez as the Weeknd's "muse". The Weeknd reworks Gomez's lyrics from the song "Same Old Love" on the song "Wasted Times" in a way that Billboard described as "tormenting".</p>
