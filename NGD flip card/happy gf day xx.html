                                i wish i could be there to give you flowers and a handwritten card today, but i hope this will do for now... <br><br>

                                loving you has been the easiest thing i've ever done. i love every night i get to fall asleep w you, and waking up next to you will forever be one of my favorite things in the world. my nights feel shorter when i spend them w you, and meals seem to taste better when i have convos with you to go with them. <br><br>

                                over the past few months, you have easily become someone i never want to lose in my life. you are my safe space, my home, my comfort zone. you make me feel like i can show you all of my corners and rough edges without fear of judgment. you somehow bring out the most vulnerable side of me that no one else ever gets to see â€“ thank you for making me feel safe enough to be myself around you. <br><br>
                                
                                versions of us will continue to grow and change, and i can't wait to fall in love with each and every version of you over and over again. you're my favorite person ever and i'm so lucky to be able to call you my girlfriend. if i'm ever lucky enough to spend all my days loving you and being bathed in your love i promise i will never take it for granted. <br><br>

                                each day i get to call you my girlfriend is a reminder that i am the luckiest girl in the world. nothing makes me feel as rich as i do being loved by you. my heart is yours for as long as you want. you have turned my world upside down in the best way possible. give me a call whenever you're free today. happy national girlfriend day, i love you! <br><br>

                                until the end of time,<br>
                                belinda
